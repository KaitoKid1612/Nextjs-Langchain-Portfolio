          My name is Mr Bin and I am a self-taught software developer
          from VietNam. I started programming in 2017, at the age of 26, and
          since then I have created hundreds of tutorials on my YouTube channel{" "}

          I also have experience with Android development but have stopped
          working with it a few years ago. I prefer web development because you
          can use a modern website on almost every device and reach the whole
          world with it.

        <H2>Hobbies</H2>
        <p>
          Besides programming, I love doing sports. I lift weights and do
          Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I also enjoy reading books and going out
          sometimes. I think having hobbies other than coding is important for
          mental health.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m also very much into self-improvement, nutrition, and positive
          psychology.
